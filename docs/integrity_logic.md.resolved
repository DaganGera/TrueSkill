# Integrity & Authenticity Logic

The platform uses client-side heuristics to discourage cheating without invasive surveillance.

## Mechanisms

1.  **Visibility Detection (`document.hidden`)**
    -   We listen for the `visibilitychange` event.
    -   If the user switches tabs or minimizes the browser, a specific message is triggered.
    -   *Hackathon Implementation*: We alert the user and log a "Violation". In a real system, this would flag the session for review.

2.  **Clipboard Blocking (`copy`, `paste`)**
    -   We intercept `copy` and `paste` events on the `document`.
    -   `e.preventDefault()` is called to stop the action.
    -   This prevents copying questions to search engines or pasting pre-written answers.

3.  **Browser Extension Concept (Future)**
    -   For production, a browser extension would be required to lock down the environment further (preventing new tabs entirely).
    -   Current "Guard" is a lightweight, privacy-respecting MVP alternative.
