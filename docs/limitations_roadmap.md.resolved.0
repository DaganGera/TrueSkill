# Limitations & Future Roadmap

## Limitations (Hackathon MVP)
1.  **AI Simulation:** In this demo, AI responses are mocked/deterministic to ensure checking stability & avoid API costs during judging.
2.  **Auth:** Authentication is purely frontend-based (localStorage) for demonstration.
3.  **Persistence:** Data stored in memory resets on server restart.

## Future Scope
1.  **Real LLM Integration:** Connect to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro for dynamic, infinite question generation.
2.  **Proctoring:** WebRTC video proctoring and browser locking extension.
3.  **LMS Integration:** Connect with Canvas/Blackboard for universities.
4.  **Code Execution Sandbox:** Allow users to run code snippets safely in the browser.
5.  **Multilingual Support:** Auto-translate questions for non-native speakers.
