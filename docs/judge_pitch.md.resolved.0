# Judge Pitch (60-90 Seconds)

**Problem:**
Traditional coding tests are biased. They filter out great candidates who are neurodiverse, have non-traditional backgrounds, or simply don't memorize algorithms. Recruiters lose talent, and candidates lose confidence.

**Solution:**
We built an **Adaptive, Inclusive Skill Evaluation Platform**.
It uses Generative AI to move beyond multiple-choice questions.

**Key Features:**
1.  **Reasoning over Syntax:** We ask "Why?" not just "How?".
2.  **Accessibility First:** Native Text-to-Speech and Cognitive Load reducers built-in.
3.  **Holistic Analytics:** A radar chart showing problem-solving and communication, not just code correctness.

**Impact:**
-   **Students** verify their actual potential.
-   **Companies** find hidden gems they would have otherwise rejected.
-   **Society** moves towards a truly meritocratic tech industry.

**Why this matters:**
Innovation needs diversity. Our platform ensures the door is open for every brilliant mind, regardless of how they learn or test.
